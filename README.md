# 🤖 Chatbot Development using NLP  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of the **AICTE Internship**, where we are building a chatbot using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. In **Week 1**, the focus was on setting up the foundational chatbot framework, defining intents, and handling basic interactions.  

## ✅ Week 1 Progress  
✔️ Defined various chatbot intents and structured responses  
✔️ Enhanced response quality for better user interaction  
✔️ Introduced a new intent: **Loan Eligibility**  
✔️ Improved code readability and organization  
✔️ Integrated key libraries: **NLTK, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **NLTK** (Text Processing)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning for Text Classification)  
- **Streamlit** (Interactive Web UI)  

## 🔧 Installation Steps  
Install the required libraries before running the chatbot:  
```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit
```  

## 🚀 Running the Chatbot  
1. Download the project files or clone the repository.  
2. Run the chatbot using Streamlit:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```  
3. Start chatting through the web interface!  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Train an **ML model** to improve response accuracy.  
- Implement **context-aware** conversations.  
- Deploy the chatbot on cloud services for accessibility.
